    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <div class="half-white paragraph-container">
        <p>A long time ago in a land far, far away the young Queen who ruled the land fell ill.</p>
        <p>While her counselors bickered amongst themselves jockeying for power, more concerned 
          about succession and politics than for their Queen's health, 
          counselors being generally of such a type likely to forget the actual person 
          behind title and power, it was the common folk who worried for their Queen 
          and prayed for her good health.</p>
        <p>The Queen, though still young, had already endeared herself to 
          them. It was in the hearts and good will of her people that she had the most support, 
          the most love. This was the source of her power.</p>
